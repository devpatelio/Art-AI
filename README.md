# Art-AI
A cool program part of an exercise that I modified in order to take any picture and turn it into art! (its kinda just a compression algorithm for images but like still shhhhh)


*Note: This was an assignment from the Andrew Ng Machine Learning Course that I had to complete -- the only code that I used from the assignment that was prewritten is the actual plotting code whereas all other math, functions, and hard-work stuff is by me so like don't play me*
